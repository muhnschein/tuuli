# Harbour listing rules, checked against the source tree.
#
# `sfdk check -s harbour` is the authority, and it needs a built RPM and
# the Sailfish SDK -- minutes of runner time and a multi-gigabyte image
# (.github/workflows/rpm.yml). This answers the same questions from the
# sources instead, so a change that would fail intake fails the pull
# request that introduces it.
#
# The rules come from the vendored copies of the validator's own
# allow-lists (ci/harbour/, refreshed by scripts/update-harbour-rules.sh);
# only the logic around them is reimplemented, from rpmvalidation.sh. Check
# IDs are docs/HARBOUR.md's, which follow Jolla's own numbering.
#
# Adapted from Postivene's ci/harbour-check.sh (same author) for this
# tree's layout: the .desktop file under src/app/, the QML under src/qml/,
# the Rust under crates/ and servo/.
#
# bash, not sh, and deliberately: the .conf files are written as bash
# extglob patterns (`libcrypto.so.3?((OPENSSL_3.*))`), and matching them
# with anything else would silently accept what Harbour rejects.
