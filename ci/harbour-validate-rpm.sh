# Run Jolla's own validator against a built RPM, and judge the result
# against ci/harbour/waivers.conf.
#
# This is the authority `ci/harbour-check.sh` stands in for: only a built
# package shows the Requires and Provides rpm generated, the stripped
# binary's symbols, and the real file modes. It needs an RPM, so it runs in
# .github/workflows/rpm.yml rather than on every pull request.
#
# Known blockers do not fail it. They are already recorded in
# ci/harbour/waivers.conf, the source check already reports them, and a
# workflow that is red for a reason nobody intends to fix this week is a
# workflow people stop reading. Anything *not* waived fails.
#
#     ci/harbour-validate-rpm.sh <rpm>
#     ci/harbour-validate-rpm.sh --log <saved validation log>
#
# The validator is upstream's, cloned rather than vendored: ci/harbour/
# carries the rules it reads, and this is the code that reads them.
# $HARBOUR_VALIDATOR points at an existing clone.
